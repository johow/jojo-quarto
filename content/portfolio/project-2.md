#### Project Details

Based on concepts of genetic reproduction (identity by descent), kinship differences 
within a family tree can be efficiently mapped in a kinship matrix (i.e. as a sparse matrix,
Therneau, 2015). In the data for the two populations studied, the historical Krummhörn (18th-19th century) 
and the early Québec region (17th/18th century), the vast majority of all documented individuals can be assigned 
to a single large genealogy in this way - with over 74,000 members in the case of the Krummhörn database (KH) 
and over 300,000 members in the case of the Québec population register. For the KH, more than 2000 mothers 
can be identified within this large initial family tree for the period between 1720 and 1874, who founded 
so-called “fully documented” families, and who - just like their spouse(s) - also come from “fully documented” 
families. This is a prerequisite for being able to identify the parental relationship of the established index 
families with sufficient accuracy. For the demonstration purposes of this page, however, the database had to be
limited to a sample of only 32 randomized mothers in order to avoid having to publish the entire KH database at 
the same time.
